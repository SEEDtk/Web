=head1 ErdbDocWidget Script

This is a small script that generates the documentation widget for an ERDB
database. It is designed to fit inside an embedded frame. The widget appears as
a two-column table with a scrolling select control on the left and the
documentation for the selected component on the right.

The following CGI parameters are used.

=over 4

=item database

Name of the database to document.

=item xmlFileName

Name of the XML file to document. If this option is specified, it overrides
B<database>. In this case, it is presumed the documentation is for a database
in development rather than a live database.

=item rows

The estimated number of rows to display in the select box in order to make the
widget fit comfortably inside the frame.
