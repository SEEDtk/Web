<h1>Getting Started Using GIT for Code Development in SEEDtk</h1>
<h2>Projects: Where to Go to Find Code</h2>

<p>Within the SEEDtk Project we have defined a set of projects.  Each project directory can be found
in SEEDtk/GIT/<i>project-name</i>.  Each project directory will include two subdirectories</p>
<ol class="notes">
<li><b>lib</b> will contain perl modules and</li>
<li><b>scripts</b> will contain perl scripts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following projects form the core of SEEDtk:</p>

<ul class="notes">
<li><b>tbltools</b> includes the code for svc-scripts, as well
the general databse access scripts (e.g., <i>all_entities, get_entities, </i>and</i> get_relationship</i>).
When you code an svc-script, there are usually two components: 
<ol class="notes">
<li>A core subroutine will be placed in tbltools/lib/STKServices.pm which can be invoked from
any Perl script to gain the basic functionality via a subroutine call.</li>
<li> Then the actual svc-script is put into tbltools/scripts.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><b>RASTtk</b> is the project used to hold code that is shared with the
old SEED world.</li>
<li><b>kernel</b> contains the collection of tools that make up the SEEDtk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the code a user or developer adds will go into the <i>kernel</i> 
project with a few occasional svc-scripts in <i>tbltools</i>.</p>

<h2>Maintaining the Source in GIT</h2>

<p>The original SEED Project used CVS, and it worked remarkably well.
Users developing code in SEEDtk will be using GIT.  They can elect
to use Eclipse (get help from <a href="mailto:bparrello@figresearch.com">Bruce Parrello</a>) or they can use
a much more primitive style analogous to the old CVS commands.
Here we summarize the command line style.</p>
<ol class="notes">
<li>Code development can be done anywhere, as long as you source
<i>usr-env.sh</i> using something like
<pre>
      source /home/SEEDtk/GIT/SEEDtk/user-env.sh
</pre>
which assumes that you set up SEEDtk in /home/SEEDtk.</li>

<li>Before beginning to debug a new program, we suggest that you
run
<pre>
      pull-all
</pre>
which pulls all changes others have made.</li>

<li> Code and debug your program.</li>

<li>Copy your new script to the appropriate scripts directory, usually
something like
<pre>
  mv CODE.pl /home/SEEDtk/GIT/kernel/scripts
  cd /home/SEEDtk/GIT/kernel/scripts</pre>
or
<pre>
  mv CODE.pl /home/SEEDtk/GIT/tbltools/scripts
  cd /home/SEEDtk/GIT/tbltools/scripts
</pre>
</li>
<li>then run
<pre>
  git -add CODE.pl
  git commit -m "added code CODE.pl"
  git pull
  git push
</pre>
Make sure that you check for errors on the pull before running the push.
If you get one, you probably have a conflict.  To fix this, you go to CODE.pl,
fix it, rerun the add, commit, and push.</li>
</ol>
<p>
These are just minimal notes to get you started, but if you are careful,
you should be able to fairly painlessly develop code.  Eventually, you will
probably get into errors that are difficult to resolve.  When you get there,
ask for help.
