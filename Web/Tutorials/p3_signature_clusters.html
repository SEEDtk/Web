<h1>Computing Signature Clusters: an Application of the Command-Line Tools</h1>
<h2>Introduction: What is a Signature Cluster?</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we show how to use a tool that we have created to
help you locate clusters of genes that distinguish genomes from
two designated sets of genomes.  For example, suppose that you have
a set of genomes from a given species and a second set from different species
in the same genus.  In this case, we might look for chromosomal clusters that occur in
most genomes from the specific species, but almost never occur in genomes
from a different species in the same genus.  This is just one of a growing set of tools
you can use to access PATRIC data, but we think of it as extremely interesting.</p>
<p>
So, the general operation we are implementing might be described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Define a set of closely-related genomes (usually a set of genomes
from a single species).  Call this set <b>GS1</b>.</li>
<li>
Define a second set of genomes which will be used for comparison and
call it <b>GS2</b>. Typically this would be a set establishing a "context".
The usual contents of <b>GS2</b> would be genomes from the same genus,
but different species.</li>
<li>
Then define the notion of <i>signature family</i> as a protein family in
which all members (or almost all members) occur in all genomes in <b>GS1</b>,
but none (or very few) genomes in <b>GS2</b>.</li>
<li>
Finally, define a <i>signature cluster</i> as a set of instances of
signature families that occur close to one another on the contigs
of a genome in <b>GS1</b>.  Since a signature cluster contains only
signature families, by definition it can occur in <b>GS1</b>, but only very seldom in
<b>GS2</b>.</li></ol>
<p>We will argue that the signature clusters are very effective for
locating chromosomal clusters that are very local phylogentically and
correspond to molecular machines that are quite different from those
that include the core cellular machinery.  They are things like</p>

<ul>
<li>virulence factors,
<li>antibiotic fabrication mechanisms,
<li>prophages,
<li>special transportation cassets,
<li> and so forth.
</ul>

<h2>How to Compute Signature Clusters</h2>

<p>In this short tutorial we will compute signature clusters for
<i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>.  The actual computation can be done
for any genus and species for which you have enough genomes (say,
20 within the species and 20 from different species within the same genus).</p>

<h3> Step 1: Defining GS1 and GS2</h3>

<p>The following three commands create three tables encoding genome sets.
Note that each row in each table contains two fields-- a genome id and a genome name.
</p>
<pre class="call">
p3-all-genomes --attr genome_name --eq genome_name,Streptococcus &gt;all.strep.genomes
</pre>
<pre class="resp">
genome.genome_id    genome.genome_name
1313.7014   Streptococcus pneumoniae P310839-218
208435.3    Streptococcus agalactiae 2603V/R
171101.6    Streptococcus pneumoniae R6
160490.10   Streptococcus pyogenes M1 GAS
568814.3    Streptococcus suis BM407
862971.3    Streptococcus anginosus C238
888833.3    Streptococcus australis ATCC 700641
864569.5    Streptococcus bovis ATCC 700338
482234.3    Streptococcus canis FSL Z3-227
</pre>
<pre class="call">
p3-match --col 2 pyogenes &lt;all.strep.genomes &gt;pyogenes
</pre>
<pre class="resp">
genome.genome_id    genome.genome_name
160490.10   Streptococcus pyogenes M1 GAS
1314.192    Streptococcus pyogenes strain NGAS322
798300.3    Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS15252
864568.3    Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 10782
1314.198    Streptococcus pyogenes strain NGAS743
1314.197    Streptococcus pyogenes strain NGAS596
1314.196    Streptococcus pyogenes strain NGAS327
1314.168    Streptococcus pyogenes strain 19615
301451.4    Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M18 strain CPost
</pre>
<pre class="call">
p3-match --col 2 pyogenes --reverse &lt;all.strep.genomes &gt;not.pyogenes
</pre>
<pre class="resp">
genome.genome_id    genome.genome_name
1313.7014   Streptococcus pneumoniae P310839-218
208435.3    Streptococcus agalactiae 2603V/R
171101.6    Streptococcus pneumoniae R6
568814.3    Streptococcus suis BM407
862971.3    Streptococcus anginosus C238
888833.3    Streptococcus australis ATCC 700641
864569.5    Streptococcus bovis ATCC 700338
482234.3    Streptococcus canis FSL Z3-227
862969.3    Streptococcus constellatus subsp. pharyngis C1050
</pre>
<p>The first command looks at all of the PATRIC genomes, keeps only
those which have 'Streptococcus' within the <i>genome_name</i> field,
and writes out one line for each extracted <i>Streptococcus</i> genome.
This is actually a fairly complex incantation, so we urge you to
try to construct the corresponding command for a different species (say,
<i>Staphylococcus</i>).</p>
<p>
Then the <i>p3-match</i> commands create a list of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>
genomes and a set of <i>Streptococcus</i> genomes that are not from the
<i>pyogenes</i> species.</p>
<p>
Once you have constructed your genome sets, verify that they include what
appear to be a reasonable collection of genomes.
</p>
<h3>Computing Signature Clusters</h3>
<p>
Now that we have <b>GS1</b> and <b>GS2</b> defined, we can compute the
signature clusters using something like
</p>
<pre class="call">
p3-related-by-clusters --col=1 --gs1 pyogenes --gs2 not.pyogenes --sz1 20 --sz2 20 --min 0.8 --max 0.1 --iterations 2 --output Strep
</pre>
<p>Let us briefly discuss the process being requested:</p>
<ol>
<li> First, we take 20 random genomes from <b>GS1</b>
and 20 from <b>GS2</b> (these sizes are specified by <b>sz1</b> and <b>sz2</b>)
Then, we compute the protein families that occur in at
least 80% of the genomes in <b>GS1</b>, but no more than 10% of the genomes in
<b>GS2</b> (the thresholds are specified by the <b>min</b> and <b>max</b>
arguments).  These are the <i>signature families</i> that we will use to
search for <i>signature clusters</i>.</li>
<li> Then we compute the desired signature clusters, based on the randomly selected
genome sets.</li>
<li>We save the clusters computed; this is called a single <i>iteration</i>.
We redo the selection of random genomes, computation of signature families, and
computation of signature clusters (added to a growing set), until we
have completed the requested number of iterations (in our example, we specified "2").</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thus, we build up a collection of signature clusters recorded in the designated output
directory. If you look in the file <i>related.signature.clusters</i> in this directory, you will
see something like the following, showing the family pairs found and how many times each
pair occurs.</p>
<pre class="resp">
PGF_00091842    PGF_02991161    106
PGF_03507811    PGF_03520364    75

PGF_00413443    PGF_02239557    48
PGF_00423533    PGF_03512306    46
PGF_03504450    PGF_03507868    45
PGF_00006421    PGF_00341140    44

PGF_00011284    PGF_00011285    41
PGF_00053076    PGF_00221701    41
</pre>
<p>In the next section, we will show how to put these results in a more useful form.</p>

<h3>Looking at the Results</h3>
<p>
To look at the computed signature clusters, use something like</p>
<pre class="call">
p3-format-results -d Strep | p3-aggregates-to-html &gt;clusters.html
</pre>
<p>The results will look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../img/pic1.png"  border="2"/></p>
<p>If you click on the feature ID, you will be taken to the Patric Feature Page for that feature:</p>
<p><img src="../img/pic3.png"  border="2"/></p>
<p>If you click the circled C on a feature, you will see a "Compare Regions" screen centered on that feature, like this:</p>
<p><img src="../img/pic2.png" style="width: 40%: height: 40%"  border="2"/></p>
<p>If you click on a family id, you will be taken to a Patric Family Page:</p>
<p><img src="../img/pic4.png" border="2"/></p>
<h2> Summary </h2>

<p>We have implemented a tool that, given two sets of genomes, will compute
the signature clusters that occur (or tend to occur) in genomes from
one set but not in genomes from the other. The sets of genomes are
taken from the current release of the PATRIC database.</p>
<p>
We have illustrated one intended use: finding the signature clusters
that distinguish a species from other species within a phylogenetic
context (the genus).</p>
<p>
There are others that you might try.  For example, if you wanted to find
which EC numbers occur in clusters of signature families for <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i>, but not in <i>Streptococcus
pyogenes</i>, you should be able to locate these (as well as those that occur in <i>S.pyogenes</i>,
but not in <i>S.pneumo</i>).
