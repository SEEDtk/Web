<h2>Subsystems, Roles, and Functions</h2>

In this section we try to convey what we mean by the
terms <i>subsystem<i>, <i>role</i>, and <function of a gene</i>.
This is an extremely simplified explanation.  It is given solely
to convey the basic concepts behind our efforts to annotate 
microbial genomes.

We think of a genome as containing the designs of 
a set of molecular machines (e.g., pathways, transport
casettes and regulatory mechanisms).  The protein-encoding genes (PEGs)
that occur within the genome encode components of these machines.
Each component has an associated <i>role</i>.  The collection of roles
that make up the design of a molecular machine are called a <i>subsystem</i>.
Thus, each subsystem is just an inventory of the roles that make up 
the machinery of a cell.
<p>
Each peg has an associated function.  Some of these functions are,
as of now, unknown.  When a peg implements a single role (that is, the
peg encodes a protein that implements one of the roles in a subsystem),
we speak of the role as the <i>function of the peg</i>.
<p>
Pegs can implement multiple roles. When we show the function of a peg
as <i>role1 / role2</i> we mean that the peg is multifunctional and
separate sections of the encoded protein implement both <i>role1</i> and <i>role2</i>. 
When a multifunctional protein implements two roles due to
broad specificity, we write the function of the peg as <i>role1 @ role2 </i>.
Finally, if we believe that a function is probably one of two roles,
we write the function as <i>role1; role2</i>.  This notation easily generalizes to
the few cases in which we believe a peg's function implements three or more roles.
<p>
The collection of subsystems maintained in PATRIC describe the inventories of
roles needed to implement specific molecular machines.  For each genome
within PATRIC we have tried to construct the set of pegs that implement
the roles of each subsystem believed to be represented in the genome, and
we refer to the set of pegs instantiating a subsystem as a <i>populated subsystem</i>.
