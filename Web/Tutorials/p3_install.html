<H1> Installing the CLI Release</h1>
We currently only have a Mac OSX release of the CLI package, but we
should soon have a Windows version as well. In the past we have created
Ubuntu packaging for this technology as well and may do so if there is
a demand for it.
<p>
The releases are available at the
<a href="https://github.com/PATRIC3/PATRIC-distribution/releases">PATRIC3 github site</a>.
</p>
<p>
Download the latest version of the PATRIC dmg (disk image) file. Click on the
downloaded file to open it, and drag the PATRIC icon on to the Application
folder icon. This will install into your Applications folder.</p>
<p>
Then doubleclick on the PATRIC icon in the Applications folder. This will
bring up a new Terminal window that is configured for access to the
PATRIC command line tools.
