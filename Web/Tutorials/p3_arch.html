<h1>The P3-Scripts Interface to PATRIC</h1>

<h2>What is the PATRIC Command-line Interface?</h2>

<a href="https: www.patricbrc.org" target=_blank>PATRIC</a> is an integration of different types of data and software tools
that support research on bacterial pathogens.
The typical biologist seeking access to the PATRIC data and tools will usually explore
the web-based user interface.  However, there are many instances in which programatic or command-line
interfaces are more suitable.  For users that wish command-line access to PATRIC, we provide
the tools described in this document.  We call these tools the <i>P3-scripts</i>.  They
are intended to run on your machine, going over the network to access the services provided by PATRIC.
If you have not already installed a version on your machine, you should probably follow the instructions
discussed in the next section and install a version now.

<h3>Installing the P3-scripts</h3>

<pre>--------------------EVOLVING NOTES -------------------</pre>

<h3> What Is a PATRIC Workspace?</h3>

<p>Users of PATRIC have access to a wealth of public data that support
interpretation of prokaryotic genomes.  The PATRIC team actively integrates newly-sequenced
genomes, data relating to antimicrobial resistance, expression data, pathway data and subsystem data
into an integrated framework that can be queried using either the PATRIC UI or the CLI.</p>

<p>In the PATRIC UI, your workspace looks a lot like a standard file system, divided into folders full of
data. In addition to files you upload, such as FASTA and FASTQ files, there will also be typed objects
such as genomes, feature sets, and genome sets. The CLI allows you to move these typed objects between
your workspace and your file system so you can manipulate them at will.</p>

<p>To access your workspace, you need a PATRIC account. If you do not have one already, go to
<a href="https://user.patricbrc.org/register">https://user.patricbrc.org/register</a> and register
now.</p>

<p>Now that you have a working user name and password, you can use the <b>p3-login</b> script to
tell the CLI who you are. For example, if your name is <code>rastuser25</code>, you would type</p>

<pre>
    p3-login rastuser25
</pre>

<p>The script asks you for your password and places a special file on your hard drive that can be used
to get authorized access to your workspace data. To log out again, simply use</p>

<pre>
    p3-login --logout
</pre>


<p>At any time, you can verify your login status using</p>

<pre>
    p3-login --status
</pre>

<p>If you are logged out, it will respond</p>
<blockquote class="resp">
You are currently logged out of PATRIC.

</blockquote>
<p>If you are logged in, you will get something like</p>
<blockquote class="resp">
You are logged in as rastuser25@patricbrc.org.

</blockquote>
<p>Your workspace looks like a full-blown file system, but there are three special folders.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Genome Groups</b> contains named lists of genomes.</li>
<li><b>Feature Groups</b> contains named lists of features.</li>
<li><b>QuickData</b> contains folders full of genomes you submitted through the CLI annotation interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>To create a genome group, you use <b>p3-put-genome-group</b>. Say, for example, you want to examine
streptococcus genomes that are resistant to penicillin. The following query command will get the list
of genomes (we will discuss all query commands in more details later).</p>

<pre>
p3-drug-amr-data --eq genome_name,Streptococcus --eq resistant_phenotype,resistant --eq antibiotic,penicillin
                 --attr genome_id --attr genome_name &gt;genomes.tbl
</pre>

<p>The command is broken into two lines for readability, but is entered as a single line. This particular
command asks for data from the anti-microbial resistance table. Each record in this table posits a relationship
between a genome and an antibiotic drug. The parameters do the following.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>--eq genome_name,Streptococcus</code></dt>
<dd>Only include records for Streptococcus genomes.</dd>
<dt><code>--eq resistant_phenotype,resistant</code></dt>
<dd>Only include records that state the genome is resistant.</dd>
<dt><code>--eq antibiotic,penicillin</code></dt>
<dd>Only include records that concern the antibiotic penicillin.</dd>
<dt><code>--attr genome_id</code></dt>
<dd>Output the genome ID.</dd>
<dt><code>--attr genome_name</code></dt>
<dd>Output the genome name.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When the command completes, the file <b>genomes.tbl</b> will contain around 115 lines beginning with
the following.</p>

<blockquote class="resp">
genome_drug.genome_id   genome_drug.genome_name
1313.7006   Streptococcus pneumoniae P310010-154
1313.7016   Streptococcus pneumoniae P310937-212
1313.7018   Streptococcus pneumoniae P311313-217
760749.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA05248
760763.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA11304
760765.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA11663
760766.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA11856
760769.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA13338
760771.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA13455
760776.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA14373
760777.3    Streptococcus pneumoniae GA14688

</blockquote>

<p>Now we want to create a group for these genomes called <b>resist.strep</b>. We use the following command.</p>

<pre>
p3-put-genome-group --col=1 resist.strep &lt;genomes.tbl
</pre>

<p>The <code>--col=1</code> tells the command that the genome IDs are in the first column. You can read the group back at any time
using <b>p3-get-genome-group</b>.</p>



<h2>Using PATRIC Apps: Assembling Reads and Annotating Genomes</h2>

There are a growing number of PATRIC apps, and you will be able to use many of them via the CLI.
To illustrate how, we show you how to assemble collections of reads into contig, and how to annotate one
or more genomes (hundreds at a time, if you wish).

<h3>Moving Data To and From Your PATRIC Workspace</h3>

<h3> Assembling Reads Into Contigs </h3>

The assembly app allows you to take one or more files of DNA <i>reads</i>
and produce an output file containing DNA <i>contigs</i>.  The exact steps one would use
to assemble reads are as follows:
<ol>
<li> Upload the one or more files containing reads to your workspace:
<pre>
  example commands following exactly what is shown in the previous section
</pre>

<li> Now use....
</ol>

<h3> Annotating Genomes</h3>

<pre> This requires a dsicussion of

The PATRIC app that can be used to annotate a genome takes as input
<ol>
<li>a file of contigs,
<li>the genetic code used by the organism (use "4" if you are
annotating a <i>Mycoplasma</i> and "11", otherwise).  See
<a LINK TO NCBI> for details.

<li>The taxonomy ID you wish to assign to the genome (see <a ...> for details)
</ol>

It produces as output a <i>Genome Type Object (GTO)</i>.  This object
contains all of the data created during the annotation.  You can download a GTO
to your machine and then use p3-scripts to extract data from the GTO.
Here is an example of how to download the output GTO and get a listing of
the features identified in the annotations.

</pre>

<h1>Extracting Data from PATRIC</h1>

You can do a great deal more with the CLI than just run PATRIC apps -- you can extract a large and
growing body of data that you may well find useful in studying organisms and their genomes.

<h2>The Entities</h2>

You can think of PATRIC as a collection of data items that describe entities of just a few types.
<i>Genomes</i> and <i>Features</i> are the most commonly accessed types of entities.

<pre>

============== Evolving Notes

</pre>

The P3-scripts interface reflects an underlying ERDB.
The initial implemenation will offer access to the following
entities:
<ul>
<li>Genome
<li>Feature
<li>ProteinFamily
<li>Role
<li>Subsystem
<li>PopSys (a row in a populated subsystem)
<li>Drug
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Data from an Entity (set)</h3>

For each entity we support something like
<pre>
  p3-get-Genome-data SearchFor FieldsToExtract

      id is always default field

</pre>
Here <i>SearchFor</i> encodes a set of search contraints.
<i>FieldsToExtract</i> encodes a list of desired attributes.
For important relationships, we use things like
<pre>
  p3-Genome2Drug SearchFor FieldsToExtract
</pre>

<h2>Tables, Commands, and Headers</h2>

Many of the P3-scripts are commands that take a tab-separated table with column headers
as input and produce an altered table as output.  The decision to use column headers is a
deviation from the tools we built as SVR and SVC scripts.  It has both benefits and costs.
For the unix commands our use of headers introduces surmountable complexities.  For example,
we will implement <b>P3-sort</b> as a command that reads and prints the header line, and then uses
<br>
<pre>
  tail ``-n+2'' | sort
</pre>
to print the sorted contexts of the file.  There will be P3-scripts corresponding to at
least the following UNIX tools:
<ul>
<li>echo (p3-echo)
<li>head (p3-head)
<li>tail (p3-tail)
<li>grep (p3-grep)
<li>sort (p3-sort)
<li>cut  (p3-cut)
The Unix <i>cut</i> does not let you establish the order of the retained columns.
p3-cut (which is a renamed version of svc_extract) will.


<h2>Classes of Commands that Need to be Cast as P3-scripts</h2>

<h3>Access to the PATRIC Workspaces</h3>

We have a set of commands that support creation and maintenance of PATRIC workspaces.

<h3>Running PATRIC apps and Retrieving the Ouput</h3>

We support the ability to run apps and retrieve the output.

<h3>Extracting, Copying, and Mining Genome Typed Objects (GTOs) </h3>

<h2>Queries that Need to be Supported</h2>
Note that some of the queries could probably best be handled using
code from someone else.  That would, of course, be fine with me.

</pre>


<li>Are pegs P1 and P2 located within 5 kb of one another on the chromosome?
<li>Give me a fasta file of the contigs of genome G.
<li>Give me the protein sequences for the pegs in genome G.
<li>Given a list of genomes L, produce a list of pairs of roles that are implemented
    by pegs (from genomes in L) that are close on the chromosome (along with a count of the number of occurrences of the pair).
<li> Given two sets of genomes Gs1 and Gs2, list the roles implemented in genomes in Gs1, but not by
genomes implemeted in Gs2.
<li>What is the average length of proteins in family F, along with the standard deviation.
<li>What genomes in list Gs have GC content values greater than 60%.
<li>For functional roles R1 and R2, give a correlation coefficient for occurrences of pegs implementing
these roles in the entire set of genomes.
<li>For subsystems S1 and S2, compute the correlation coeffient of occurrences of S1 and S2
in a list of genomes.
<li>Compute the minimum number of unique roles in the subsystem S that are implemented by pegs.  That is
    calculate <i>min_pegs</i>, the minimum number of pegs required for an active instance of the subsystems
(at least so far).  Which genomes have only <i>min_pegs</i> in an active instance?
<li>Compute the upstream and downstream regions for pegs in list pegL.
<li>Return features from a designated list of types for a genome G -- sorted by location on the chromosome.
<li>Given a genome G that does not occur in subsystem S, compute the minimum sets of roles needed to
    include all of the roles that occur in at least one active role (there may be multiple ways
    to complete an incomplete set).
<li>Which kmers occur in one list of genomes, but not in a second set?  Here we are defining
signature kmers.
<li>Which roles occur in one list of genomes, but not in a second set?  Here we are defining signature roles.
<li>Which subsystems occur in one list of genomes, but not in a second set?  Here we are defining signature subsystems.
<li>Compute the codon usage for pegs in a specified genome.  This requires getting the DNA sequence
    for the genome, getting the peg translations, and tabulating the codon counts.
<li>Given a possible frameshift (in the form of two adjacent pegs), try to "fix it".  We have a version
of the code to do this, and it involves a Smith-Waterman algorithm.  Hopefully, we can just lift the
existing version.
<li>Given a genome G, get roles that may be split over multiple contigs.
<li>Given a genome G and a close genome G', use G' to look for pegs in G1 that might span contigs.
