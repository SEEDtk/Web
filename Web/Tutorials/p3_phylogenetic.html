<h1>What Distinguishes Phylogentic Groups</h1>

<!-- User has to build his own tree, we do not currently have PATRIC support that we know how to use.
Examples are in SEEDtk/Data/TutWC/for.rebecca -->

In a previous tutorial we covered how to compute <i>signature clusters</i>
that distinguish sets of genomes (see <b>Computing Signature Clusters:
an Application of the Command-Line Tools</b>).

Here we show how to generate genome sets corresponding to subtrees of
a given phylogenetic tree.  The intended use is as follows:
<ol>
<li> The user generates a phylogenetic tree using PATRIC.
<li> Then he generates two sets that reflect the phylogentic groups
     that are to be distinguished.
<li> Finally, he uses the tools described in the previous tutorial
     to compute the signature clusters that distinguish the two sets.
</ol>
Here is how it is done.

<h2> Generate a Tree Containing Up to About 200 Genomes</h2>

This can be done using PATRIC.  Let's call the tree the <i>genus_tree.nwk</i>.
Note that the Newick format was not designed to be readable.
<p>
You want a tree that contains representative genomes that cover the
phylogenetic group you will use to compute signature clusters, as well
as a few more distance genomes that act as an out-group.

<h2> Pick the Two Phylogenetic Groups You Wish to Compare</h2>

Normally, you would begin by picking a single subtree containing as leaves
one of the two groups to be compared.  For now, let us use a single species
and call this initial group the <i>species group</i>.  In the original tutorial
on computing signature clusters, we used <i>Streptococcus pyogenese</i> and
<i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i> as two distinct species groups, and we selected
members using pattern-matching against the actual names of the organisms.
<p>
We are going to do something a bit more general now.  We specify the species
goup as the organisms that occur in a single subtree.  This allows us to easily
specify a subtree and form a group containing (for example) a set of three closely
related species.  Similarly, we could specify a subtree containing a subset
of a larger branch that actually contained a species (i.e., we could specify a
sub-branch of a species).

<p>
To specify the species group, first be sure your tree is rooted where you desire, otherwise an unrooted tree will automatically be rooted at the midpoint.

If you wished to look at your tree, just use

<pre>
      sketch_tree -a < rooted_tree.nwk
</pre>
which will give you a sketch of your tree (not, beautiful, but quite functional).
<p>
In a rooted subtree like the ones you will use to specify sets, you can
think of a subtree as being designated by two leaves -- one from each of the
subtrees that together form the desired subtree.  That is,
by specifying two leaves, you can designate the subtree which grows out
of the node which is the <i>most recent common ancestor</i> of the two nodes.
<p>
You can use
<pre>
        set_by_subtree G1 G2 < rooted.tree > genome.set
</pre>

to form the genome set of the genomes in the most recent common ancestor of <i>G1</i>
and <i>G2</i> (which are genome IDs occurring in two of the leaves of the tree
defined in <i>rooted.tree</i>.
<p>
You need to specify two genome sets if you wish to compute <i>signature clusters</i>.
One of these is normally just a set derived from a subtree.  The other set may be
the leaves in a disjoint subtree.  In this case, you would use

<pre>
  set_by_subtree G1 G2 < rooted.tree > genome.set.1
  set_by_subtree G3 G4 < rooted.tree > genome.set.2
</pre>

to get the two sets, and then you are ready to compute the signature clusters
using the tools described in the first tutorial.
<p>

The next most common way to specify the two sets is to make one of the two
sets the genomes in a subtree of particular interest, while the second tree
is a larger subtree that includes the set of particular interest.  This second subtree
forms a "context".  This context set should include all of the leaves in the larger
subtree, except the leaves from the subtree of particular interest.  In this case, we
would form the two genome sets using something like
<pre>
  set_by_subtree G1 G2 < rooted.tree > context-genome.set
  set_by_subtree G3 G4 < rooted.tree > subset-of-interest
  p3-inAnotB context-genome.set context-genome.set subset-of-interest > halo.set
</pre>
Now one can compute the signature clusters distinguishing <i>subset-of-interest</i>
and <i>halo.set</i>.  These clusters distinguish the subset-of-interest from
the phylogentic group from which it emerged.
